    "### Overview\n",
    "- Fingerspelling is a technique that makes use of hand formations to represent words and letters. Using fingerspelling, one can communicate information such as phone numbers, names, and even addresses. However, hearing impaired individuals find it difficult to merge the current technological advancements, such as, smartphones with fingerspelling because they happen to do it a lot faster than their devices. Therefore, there is need to bridge the gap between fingerspelling and typing on smartphones.\n",
    "- Fingerspelling has grown to become one of the most crucial manual communication systems in the world. For deaf and individuals with hearing impairment issues, fingerspelling is one of the ways that they can communicate with those around them. However, few people are able to discern figerspelling and this leads to communication breakdowns. The use of machine learning technology can help to merge fingerspelling with exact letters and symbols to help enhance communication. "

    "### Problem Statement\n",
    "- The deaf and hearing impaired community faces significant communication barriers with the rest of the society. This is because sign language is not widely understood by everyone else around them, and this can lead to difficulties in communication or communication breakdowns. To address this issue, this project aims to develop a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model specifically designed for fingerspelling recognition, allowing for accurate identification of individual letters and complete words in different sign languages. By improving the recognition of fingerspelling gestures, the model seeks to enhance communication accessibility for individuals who are deaf or hard of hearing, promoting inclusivity and fostering effective communication with the broader society."

    "### Objectives\n",
    "- Our objective is to create an innovative machine learning model that acts as a vital bridge, connecting the deaf and mute community with the wider society. This model will have the capability to translate various sign languages, including American Sign Language (ASL) and Kenyan Sign Language (KSL), into their corresponding individual letters, enabling the broader community to learn and understand sign language for improved communication with their deaf loved ones. Additionally, this development will empower the deaf and mute community to communicate effectively amongst themselves, fostering inclusivity and enhancing overall interactions. Through this project, we aspire to facilitate seamless communication, foster understanding, and promote inclusiveness between these communities."

    "### Data Understanding\n",
    "- The dataset is publicly available on Kaggle which we then added 379 images taken by the group members doing the fingerspelling.\n",
    "- The signs provided are based on the Kenyan Sign Language letter database which is made up of 24 classes of letters with the exclusion of `J` and `Z`. The two letters have been excluded because they require the use of motion. \n",
    "- Further, the dataset is divided into train and test sets each with 27455 and 7172 cases, respectively. The total number of columns for both is 784. "
